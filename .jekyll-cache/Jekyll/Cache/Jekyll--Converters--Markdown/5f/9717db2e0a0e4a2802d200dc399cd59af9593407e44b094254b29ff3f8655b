  <li>Digital Signal Processing (DSP) = DSP is the use of digital processing to perform a wide variety of signal processing operations.</li>
  <li>Waveform = A waveform describes a wave by graphing how an air molecule is displaced, over time.</li>

  <li>Frequency = Frequency is the measure of how many times the waveform repeats in a given amount of time.</li>
  <li>Hertz (Hz) = The common unit of measurements for frequency. Hz represents the number the waveform repetitions per second.</li>
  <li>Ampliture = A measure of how much a molecule is displaced from its resting position.</li>

<p>Speech signals are sound signals, defined as pressure variations travelling through the air.</p>

<p>A speech signal is then represented by a sequence of numbers $ x_n $, which represent the relative air pressure at time-instant nâˆˆâ„•.</p>

<p>This representation is known as pulse code modulation often abbreviated as PCM.</p>

<p>The accuracy of this representation is then specified by two factors;</p>

<ol>
  <li>the sampling frequency (the step in time between $ n $ and $ n+1 $).</li>
  <li>the accuracy and distribution of amplitudes of $ x_n $ .</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="sampling-rate">Sampling Rate</h3>

<p>In DSP Sampling is the reduction of a continuous-time signal to a discrete-time signal.</p>

<p>A common example is the conversion of a sound wave (a continuous signal) to a sequence of samples (a discrete-time signal).</p>

<p>An important aspect of Sampling is the Nyquist Theorem. The Nyquist Theorem states that in order to adequately reproduce a continuous-time signal it should sampled at a rate that is 2X the highest frequency you wish to record.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Nyquist Sampling</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>$ (f) = d/2 $ </strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Nyquist Sampling (f) = d</b>, where <b>d</b> is the highest frequency you wish to record <b>/ 2</b></p>

<p>Most important information in speech signals are the formants, which reside in the range 300Hz - 3500Hz. This means that the lower limit of the sampling rate will have to be between 7-8kHz.</p>
